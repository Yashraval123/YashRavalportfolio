# My Skills
1.	Presentation skill-	Presentations may seem as old as the mountains, but they are not going away any time soon. As a data scientist I am going to have to at some time or another have to prepare and deliver a presentation.	There are different approaches and techniques to effectively handle different classes of presentations which i have

2. Technical skills:
o	Sql
o	Python
o	R studio
o	Tablue & Power BI 
o	understanding networks, databases
These are the most common coding languages required in data science roles.Machine Learning has seen a great jump only because of the boost in computing power. Programming provides us a way to communicate with machines.These programming languages for example R STUDIO, PYTHON, SQL help how to organize unstructured data sets.	Tablue and power BI will aid to analyze and visualize dataset in easy and better way.
3. Intellectual Curiosity
At the heart of the data science role is a deep curiosity to solve problems and find solutions — especially ones that require some out of the box thinking. Data on its own doesn’t mean a whole lot, so a great Data Scientist is fueled by a desire to understand more about what the data is telling them, and how that information can be used on a broader scale.Hence, this is the integral skill for my brighter future.
4. Communication: Having to facilitate working meetings, asking good questions, and listening to the answers, the analysts must have good communication skills.  Being able to communicate well via conference calls and web meetings is equally important as face-to-face encounters.
